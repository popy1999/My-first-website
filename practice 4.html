        <p>You've got sand between your toes, salt in your hair, and your drink has a tiny umbrella in it. You've spent all day hopping waves, building sand castles with the kiddies, perfecting that wind-tousled style, and you're wearing the swimsuit and shades that make you feel like a rockstar. You've eaten your favorite boardwalk sweet and salty treats and maybe even taken the canoe, kayak, boat, or jet ski out for a little spin. You're living your best vacation life. And of course, you've gotten some of the best snapshots this side of the sandbar. Now, all you need are the perfect beach Instagram captions to capture the feeling of the seaside breeze in your face, that warm sun on your skin, the smell of the salty air and pineapple-scented sunscreen, and the sound of seagulls and kids alike living their best life.
